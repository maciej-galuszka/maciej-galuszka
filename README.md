## Hi, I'm Maciej 👋

I’m a mathematics student and a self-taught web developer who loves building clean, responsive interfaces and solving interesting problems. I’m aspiring to become a full-stack developer, expanding my skills beyond frontend and exploring backend technologies step by step.

I enjoy the intersection of math, programming, and real-world problem solving — and I’m always eager to learn, improve, and try new technologies.

- 🔭 Currently working on: improving my React & Next.js skills and building practical projects
- 🧠 Learning next: TypeScript, backend fundamentals (Node.js & APIs)
- 🎯 Interests: web development, computer science, mathematics, sports, and games

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

Frontend:
HTML • CSS • JavaScript • React • Next.js • TailwindCSS

Other:
Git • npm • Python

Always learning something new — with the long-term goal of becoming a strong full-stack developer.
