## Hi, my name is Maciej 👋

I’m a mathematics student with the aspiration to become a web developer. I enjoy programming because I like creating things, solving problems, and seeing my ideas come to life through code. I’m always looking for opportunities to learn and grow as a developer. At the moment I focus mainly on frontend development, with the long-term goal of gradually moving towards full-stack development.

- 🔭 Currently working on: improving my React & Next.js skills and building practical projects
- 🧠 Learning next: TypeScript, backend fundamentals (Node.js & APIs)
- 🎯 Interests: web development, computer science, mathematics, sports, and games
